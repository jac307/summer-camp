# 🌀 Re-targeting Movements in Blender  
## Using Motion Capture Data from Perception Neuron 3 (.bvh)

---

### 📌 What is MOCAP and Retargeting?

**Motion Capture (MOCAP)** is a technique for recording human movement and translating it to a digital character. In this guide, we use **.bvh files** captured with Perception Neuron 3 (PN3) and apply that movement to a custom 3D model in **Blender**.

**Retargeting** refers to the process of **mapping motion data from one skeleton (e.g., a BVH armature)** onto another (e.g., your character model), allowing different rigs or body types to perform the same animation.

## Option 1: Manual Retargeting (No Armature on Import)

This method works best when you want to manually align BVH motion to a static mesh model without pre-existing rig constraints.

### 💡 Tips
- Make sure your character is in **T-pose or A-pose** before rigging
- Avoid scaling bones in **Edit Mode** — this can break animation playback  
- Use orthographic views (`Numpad 1/3/7`) to check alignment  
- You can clean up or simplify keyframes using the **Graph Editor**

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

First, create a new Blender project and **save the file** as `Character-with-MOCAP-1.blend`.
Then, follow these steps:

#### 1. **Import Your Character Mesh**  
   - In Blender, go to `File → Import → OBJ/FBX` (or whatever format your model is in)  
   - Make sure your model **does not include an armature**

#### 2. **Import Your BVH File**  
   - Go to `File → Import → Motion Capture (.bvh)`  
   - Select your `.bvh` file  
   - Before importing: In the **Transform** panel on the right, set the **Scale** to `0.1`  
   - Click **Import BVH**  
   - This will create a **BVH armature** with baked motion keyframes

#### 3. **Align BVH Scale with Character**  
   - Your mocap character may appear larger/smaller than your mesh  
   - Use **`S` (scale)** on the **BVH armature only** (Object Mode)  
   - Do **not scale the armature in Edit Mode** or using non-uniform transforms

#### 4. **Match Bone Positions**  
   - Select the **BVH armature**  
   - Enter **Edit Mode**  
   - Move and adjust bones so they **visually align with your character’s mesh**  
   - Focus on key joints like the **shoulders, hips, knees, and feet** for accurate alignment

![Sensor Check](images/import-mocap-4.png)

#### 5. **Parent the Mesh**  
   - To apply the BVH armature to your mesh, select the **mesh first**, then **Shift+click the armature**  
   - Press `Ctrl+P` and choose **With Automatic Weights**  
   - **Note**: This works best if your mesh is **roughly aligned** with the armature  
   - **Tip**: Use **Weight Paint mode** to fine-tune how bones influence the mesh if deformations look incorrect

#### 6. **Play the Timeline**  
   - Press `Spacebar` or drag the timeline to preview the movement  
   - Your BVH skeleton should animate based on the captured motion

#### 7. **Export short video**  
   - Go to the **Output Properties** tab (printer icon in the Properties Panel).
   - Set the **frame range** to max 1-500.
   - Under **Output**, choose a location to save and set the file format to `FFmpeg video`.
   - In the **Encoding** section (appears when FFmpeg is selected):
      - Set **Container** to `MPEG-4`
      - Set **Video Codec** to `H.264`
   - Go to **Render → Render Animation** (`Ctrl + F12`).
   - Once done, your video file will be saved in the selected folder.

## Option 2: Retargeting with Auto-Rig Pro – Smart + Remap

This option uses the **Auto-Rig Pro** add-on for Blender — a powerful tool designed to simplify rigging, animation retargeting, and character preparation for games or film.

## 💡 Tips
- Make sure your character is in **T-pose or A-pose** before rigging
- If joints don’t align properly, you can manually adjust bone mapping in the **Remap** tab
- Auto-Rig Pro also supports batch retargeting for multiple animations

---

## Install Auto-Rig Pro

**Auto-Rig Pro** is a paid Blender add-on that provides tools for:
- Creating advanced rigging systems with controllers and constraints
- Retargeting motion from external sources (like BVH or FBX files)
- Exporting animations to game engines

➡️ Download and install it from your Blender Preferences:
- `Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install...`
- Select the `.zip` file, install, and enable **Auto-Rig Pro: Rig Tools**

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

First, create a new Blender project and **save the file** as `Character-with-MOCAP-2.blend`.
Then, follow these steps:

1. **Import Your Character Mesh**  
   - In Blender, go to `File → Import → OBJ/FBX` (or whatever format your model is in)  
   - Make sure your model **does not include an armature**

2. **Watch the video tutorial**
   - 🎥 **Follow only the first 10 minutes of the linked tutorial video** to complete the steps below.
   - The rest of the video covers advanced features that are not required for this exercise.

3. **Play the Timeline**  
   - Press `Spacebar` or scrub through the timeline to preview the animation on your character

4. **Export a Short Video**  
   - Use `Render → Render Animation` to export a short `.mp4` showcasing the result

## Overview of the process

### Create a Rig with Auto-Rig Pro: Smart

- Select your **character mesh**  
- Open the **Auto-Rig Pro → Smart** panel (found in the `N` sidebar under the Auto-Rig tab)
- Place the rig markers following your character’s anatomy (chin, shoulders, hips, knees, etc.)
- Click **Go!** to generate a full Auto-Rig Pro armature

🛠️ You can tweak the rig to better fit your model after generation.

### Retarget Using Auto-Rig Pro: Remap

- Go to **Auto-Rig Pro → Remap**
- Set:
  - **Source Armature** → your imported **BVH armature**
  - **Target Armature** → your newly created **Auto-Rig Pro rig**

Then configure the following:
- Enable **Auto-Scale** to match proportions
- Check **Retarget Actions** to transfer animation
- Set **Root Bone** to the **hip** of the source rig (usually `hip` or `Hips`)

Click **Remap** to complete the transfer.

## Option 3: Retargeting with Auto-Rig Pro – Existing Rig + Remap

This method is ideal if your character already comes **fully rigged with Auto-Rig Pro**, such as a model you purchased or prepared earlier. Instead of creating a new rig from scratch, you simply **retarget motion capture data onto the existing rig** using Auto-Rig Pro’s **Remap** tool.

This is the fastest workflow if:
- Your model already has a working Auto-Rig Pro rig
- You want to test BVH motion on multiple characters quickly
- You're only interested in applying and previewing motion data

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

First, create a new Blender project and **save the file** as:  
`Character-with-MOCAP-3.blend`

Then, follow these steps:

1. **Import Your Character Mesh**  
   - Go to `File → Import → FBX` or open a Blender file that includes your **Auto-Rig Pro rigged character**

2. **Import the BVH File**  
   - Go to `File → Import → Motion Capture (.bvh)`  
   - Set **scale to 0.1** in the Transform panel before importing

3. **Use Auto-Rig Pro → Remap**  
   - Open the **Remap** panel from the Auto-Rig Pro tab  
   - Set the **BVH Armature** as the **source**  
   - Set your **existing Auto-Rig Pro rig** as the **target**  
   - Enable **Auto-Scale**, **Retarget Actions**, and **set the hip bone as Root**
   - Click **Remap**

⚠️ **Warning**: Before retargeting, make sure your **existing character rig** has:
- Bone names that **match the BVH armature** (e.g., `hip`, `spine`, `left_arm`)  
- Adjusted bone positions that align with the **BVH motion structure**

If needed, enter **Edit Mode** on the target armature to rename or reposition bones.

## 💡 Tips
- If animations look off, check the bone mapping or realign your source and target rigs

4. **Play the Timeline**  
   - Press `Spacebar` or scrub through the timeline to preview the animation on your character

5. **Export a Short Video**  
   - Use `Render → Render Animation` to export a short `.mp4` showcasing the result
